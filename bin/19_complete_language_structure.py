# ------------
# What Python Library Means?
# ------------
# - python library can be a one or more modules like mymodule.py
# - python library can be a one or more package like mypackage
# - python library can be a FRAMEWORK
#       - framework is like mymodule/mypackage
#       - Difference is
#               -- in mymodule/mypackage, we are keeping only definitions
#               -- In framework, we are also keeping partial implementations
#                   for the task which is common
#                   Example: testing framework- common for all project is
#                   executing each test cases, producing summary etc are common
#                   which is implemented

# Complete Python Programming Language Structure
# ------------
# PART-1: Python Programming Langauge
#           - data types, if, for, while, functions, modules, packages,
#               classes etc
#           - Using PART-1: We can develop anything from the scratch
#           - We already developed:  program-1 to program-6
#############################

# PART-2: Builtins
# ------------
#   - few variables, functions and classes are predefined
#       and imported by default
#   - COMPLETE LIST : print(dir(__builtins__))
#   - We already used: int, float, list, tuple, str, print, type, dict many more
#############################

# PART-3: Standard Libraries
# ------------
#   - Few libraries are getting installed when we install python
#   - Difference is:
#       - builtins are imported by default
#       - Standard libraries: We need to import
#   - Location: C:\Python312\Lib
#   - Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
#############################

# PART-4: External Libraries
# ------------
# - MAIN/ BIG Repository for all python libraries
# - Location: https://pypi.org/
# - Documentation: https://pypi.org/
# - We need to download and install
#############################

# PART-5: Custom Libraries
# ------------
#   - Libraries which we develop
#   - We already developed,
#       - mymodule Library
#       - mypackage Library
